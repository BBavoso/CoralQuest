# Coral Quest

Chill out and experience an immersive underwater environment.

## Inspiration

We wanted to explore coral growth, but quickly realized our main goal was creating a calm underwater world where users could enjoy immersive sound design and interactive ambient music.

## What it does

Coral Quest guides users along an underwater track filled with fish, coral, sand, and rocks. Music plays throughout, and interactive elements like fish bubbles add subtle audio cues, creating a relaxing, immersive VR experience.

## How we built it

We used Unity for visuals and FMOD for audio. The music is composed horizontally and dynamically transitions between sections as users explore, keeping the soundscape engaging without requiring explicit interaction.

## Challenges we ran into

VR performance and visuals were tricky—we had to balance aesthetics with smooth framerates. Building for Android and ensuring cross-platform audio support also added extra complexity. Time limitations kept us from expanding environments or adding more advanced music systems.

## Accomplishments we're proud of

We’re proud of the project’s scope, vibrant visuals, music integration, spatial audio, and how intuitive and easy to use the experience is.

## What we learned

We improved Unity material and visual skills, strengthened FMOD integration, and learned to collaborate effectively on scene management. We also gained experience optimizing VR environments and cross-platform audio.

## What's next

With more time, we’d add new environments to expand sound design opportunities, create more interactivity, and potentially let users experience the world from different perspectives, like a fish’s POV.
